# Walter hardware

## Introduction

In this repository you can find all information about Walter's hardware. The
hardware is designed using KiCad but we also support Altium designer footprints.
Besides footprints you can also find:
 - Datasheets
 - 3D renders
 - Schematics

Datasheets are published as PDF and are constructed using LaTeX. We welcome any
pull request on the datasheets to make sure all information that is required is
present.
